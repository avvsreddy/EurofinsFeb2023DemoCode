Lab: Names Scores

Using names.txt (will be shared) a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting
the names into alphabetical order. Now, find the alphabetical value of each name is as follows:
COLIN is worth 3 for ‘C’ + ’15 for ‘O’ + 12 for ‘L’ + 9 for ‘I’ + 14 for ‘N’ = 53.

Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its
alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score. 

For example, when the list is sorted into
alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN
would obtain a score of 938 × 53 = 49714.

Write a program to find the total of all the name scores in the file?
