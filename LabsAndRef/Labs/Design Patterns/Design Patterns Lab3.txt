For a banking system develop “Client Updator” system.
The bank has provisions for FDA, Housing loan and business loan and it should update the client when there is a change in the rate of interests for these types of loans
The clients can be of any type and they should register with the service before getting updates
The client should also have provisions for unregistering from the interests
Each client be interested in more than one updates

Hint: Use Observer Pattern
