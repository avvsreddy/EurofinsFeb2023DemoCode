Design and Program the classes based on the following requirements.

An IDE supports different types of Programming Languages like C#, C and Java. All the programming languages have the following methods used by the IDE to support adding elements:
1. getUnit() which returns a string
2. getParadigm() which returns a string
3. getName() which returns a string
The getUnit() methods returns the string "Class" or "Function" depending on whether the language is Object Oriented or Procedural.
The getParadigm() methods returns the string "ObjectOriented" or "Procedural" depending on whether the language is Object Oriented or Procedural.
The getName() method returns the name of the language. These methods are used to design the support for the languages in an IDE.

Note: Avoid code duplication
